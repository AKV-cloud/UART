## Introduction

This project provides a UART transmitter and receiver module implemented in Verilog for use in FPGA-based designs. The UART module allows asynchronous serial communication and can be configured for different baud rates.

## Features

- Asynchronous serial communication using UART.
- Configurable baud rate.
- Supports both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) functionality.

## Design Overview

The UART transmitter and receiver module are designed to handle asynchronous serial communication. The transmitter sends data in serial format, and the receiver receives and decodes the serial data.
